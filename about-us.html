                <h2>Facts about online shopping</h2>

                <h4>What is online shopping?</h4>
                <p>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to buy a wide range of products with a single click of a button. There are a lot of different variants of online shops, some use an app other just have a website. The most famous online shop would be Amazon, which is known all over the world. Websites and Apps allow users to search for a specific item in their wide range of assortments and choose the product which fulfills their needs the most. Online shopping eliminates walking out of your house and going to a store to purchase a product, all of that can be done through a single press of a button. Payment is done through e-banking so there is no need for cash.</p>
                <h4>History of online shopping:</h4>
                <p>The history of online shopping is closely linked with the rise and expansion of the internet. Without the internet there would be no online shopping. In the early days of the internet, it was only used as an advertisement tool by different companies. One of the first industries to really try to use it as an online shop was the music industry, albums and different songs could be purchased of the internet. This expanded slightly over the years but still not every household had their own personal computer. After the price for computers got cheaper and more and more people could afford it, the market grew bigger and bigger over the years. Also because more households had PCs there was a wide variety of target groups and everybody could find something for themselves. The year 1995 was a big year for electronic retail since Amazon and eBay both launched in that year and grew to be one of the biggest stores in the world and make a lot of money through this new route to shopping.</p>
                <h4>Biggest Players in online shopping</h4>
                <p>Amazon: The biggest player in e-commerce, starting from humble beginnings as just a bookstore Jeff Bezos and his company have reached heights never been seen before. Amazon is the largest revenue maker in the world and that made Jeff Bezos one of the richest People on this Planet. Based in Seattle the Company had diversified into every nook and cranny possible. They have their own streaming services which include video and music. Including the biggest videogame streaming service called Twitch. They also innovated how people read with their Kindle devices and being able to just download a book onto them. Amazon is also invested in cloud computing and the development of artificial intelligence. As you can clearly see they are a big company how are invested heavily into IT and trying to be as future proof as possible, because technology is becoming a vital part of human life and its just going to become even more rooted into our society and how we choose to live. Amazon is a big company and they are going to become bigger in the future, they are not immune to controversy though. They have been accused of committing tax fraud, spying over their costumers and buying their information and not paying their workers enough even though they have a very stressful and taxing job.</p>
                <p>JD.com: China is a place us in the western world aren’t very familiar with, we are also not very familiar with their marketplace. Jingdong also known as just simply JD.com is one of two of the biggest 	           e-commerce companies in China. Its lesser known that Alibaba which we will talk about later, but it produces more revenue than Alibaba. The company was founded in 1998 and its retail platform went online in 2004</p>
