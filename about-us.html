                <p>The history of online shopping is closely linked with the rise and expansion of the internet. Without the internet there would be no online shopping. In the early days of the internet, it was only used as an advertisement tool by different companies. One of the first industries to really try to use it as an online shop was the music industry, albums and different songs could be purchased of the internet. This expanded slightly over the years but still not every household had their own personal computer. After the price for computers got cheaper and more and more people could afford it, the market grew bigger and bigger over the years. Also because more households had PCs there was a wide variety of target groups and everybody could find something for themselves. The year 1995 was a big year for electronic retail since Amazon and eBay both launched in that year and grew to be one of the biggest stores in the world and make a lot of money through this new route to shopping.</p>
