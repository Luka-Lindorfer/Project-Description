first of all I want to say that I haven't used a bootstrap. I programmed everything you see html and css myself. Of course, I looked up a lot of things on the internet how to do it. So let's get started with my presentation. 
First we have this header with navigation menu and logo. Next we have this text in the left side and img in the right side. I added also this button with a beautiful hover effect. Let me scroll down that you can see this images from different categoryis.
Next we have some products here which is for featured products. I added 4 Products with images. By each Product you can see the product name, the rating and the prices. You also can see a hover effect if I take the cursor on a product. As you can see I added some more products hier. 
After that we have this sexanbit for “Exclusively Product”. After that we have some testimonials. So let’s scroll down that you can see this footer with 4 different columns. At the Bottom you can see this massage. So let’s come back to the top. And if you click another page for example products. You can see my all Products page.

So let me scroll down that you can see, we have hier multiple products. I have added 12 Products. In the right side, we have this drop down option, for sorting of products. At the bottom you can see we have this buttuns for different pages. And you can see the hover effect on this button. 
Let come at the top. And hier you can see, if I click on the first product. It will open the product detail page. So this the Product detail page. First let’s scroll down that you can see wich contains we have on this webpage. After this product information we have some related products (not dynamic). And in this Product Information you can see we have the Product title, the price, this dropdown for different sizes, this button and some Product details. 
In the Left side we have this main image after that we have some small images. If I Click on a smaller image. It will display the particular image in full size. If you click on this on the image on the right side on the top (shopping bag). It will open the card page of this website. Unfortunately ,This cart page isn’t dynamic. I just added the products and wrote down the prices. For example if you add one product here it will stay 50. I will tell you more about, why I couldn’t make it dynamic with jafa script at the end of my presentation.
(At first I tried doing the registration and login with json sever, but then it didn't work so I used PHP and the databank HeidiSQL to save the users and XAMPP for running the server. Without this tow applications HeidiSQL and XAMPP it is not gonna work. If you want I can show you that on my laptop, that it works without any problems)
Let’s click on the other page which is account page. On the right side we have this form. For Registration form and login form. And login form, where you can inter the user name and password. As you can see it also moves very smoothly. Let’s open the page in a smaller screen. (You can register and it checks a lot the password etc...) If you click on the menu icon it will open the drop down menu. Let’s scroll down that you can see, the contain looks on a smaller screen perfect also.

If you click on about us you can see the content about online shopping in general and at the end you can see some information about me and my email also

What problems did I have?
As probably most of you know, my partner left school a long time ago. And then I had to continue this project on my own.
Then I did all the content about online shopping in general and the whole website in html and css. But the whole work was too much
and I couldn´t finish the dynamic part with java script alone. But I have the dynamic part with account. What I mean by that is that if I had a partner, I would have
a perfect website with dynamic part also. I hope that you will consider this, that I worked alone and that you give me a fair grade.
