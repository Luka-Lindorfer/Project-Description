First of all I want to say that I haven`t used Bootstrap. I programmed everything you see, html and css
myself. Of course, I looked up how to do a lot of things on the internet. 
What problems did I have?
As probably most of you know, my partner left school a long time ago. And then I had to continue this project on my own.
Then I did all the content about online shopping in general and the whole website in html and css. But the whole work was too much
and I couldnÂ´t finish the dynamic part with java script alone. What I mean by that is that if I had a partner, I would have
a perfect website with dynamic part also. I hope that you will consider this, that I worked alone and that you give me a fair grade.
